    <h1>About our project</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>
        The aim of our project is to predict the diseases among the trained dataset using classification algorithms. We seek to promote effective and timely decision making by timely prediction of disease.
    </p>
    <p>
        Due to modern lifestyle, diseases are increasing at an alarming rate. Our lifestyle, work type and food habits are the various factors which influence our health causing heart diseases and other health issues like Hypertension, Diabetes etc. In emerging countries like India, the urban population faces the wrath of it with 5.8 million deaths per year.
    </p>
    <p>
        Data science and AI systems can be used for prediction and detection of such lethal diseases which will in turn help to take early actions against them.
    </p>    
        In a study, the early detection alert provided 87.6% accuracy in a diagnosis and prognosis evaluation. That said, the practitioners will be able to implement treatment sooner and predict whether the patient will have a higher possibility of future disease similar to that.
    <p>
        Previously, it was challenging for healthcare professionals to collect and analyse the huge volume of data for effective predictions and treatments since there were no technologies or tools available. Now, with machine learning, itâ€™s been relatively easy, as big data technologies are mature enough for wide-scale adoption.
    </p>
    <p> 
        The system allows collection, maintenance and analysis of large amount of data which eases the process of research on these diseases and eases work of medical researchers.
